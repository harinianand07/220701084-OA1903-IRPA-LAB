6778c794e6ac7112981d4ebb239d6826,2020-03-17 02:32:10 +0000,Good for infrequent shavers in cooler months in unimportant clothes,Beauty & Personal Care,"Schmidt’s natural deodorant formulas use innovative ingredients derived from plants and minerals to help effectively neutralize odor and keep you fresh. We heard that natural deodorants never work, so we made one that does. Schmidt’s Signature Stick deodorants are free of aluminum salts, propylene glycol, parabens, phthalates, and contain no artificial fragrances or coloring. Schmidt's deodorants are made with plant-based oils and butters like coconut oil, jojoba seed oil, and shea butter, as well as vitamin E so you can smell good and feel good. Our certified vegan deodorants are also certified cruelty free. This Schmidt’s Charcoal + Magnesium gender neutral signature deodorant has a natural fragrance of freshly fallen rain. The scent variant is made with activated charcoal and magnesium, keeping you smelling fresh and feeling great. Our Charcoal + Magnesium activated charcoal deodorant formula uses baking soda and is enriched with magnesium to help neutralize odor for natural and refreshing protection and the non-greasy and non-sticky feel allows the deodorant to be easily absorbed. All of our Schmidt’s natural deodorant sticks require only a small amount of application for great results. To use, hold the product momentarily to skin to soften on contact with body heat. Gently apply a small amount to dry, clean underarms to keep you feeling fresh all day. 1-2 swipes for application is all you need. Do not apply to irritated or damaged skin.",
